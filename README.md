# Dark Slack Helper

This is a standalone script that was taken straight from [a script from WA9ACE's U](https://gitlab.com/WA9ACE/U/blob/master/packages/slack.rb).

I just wanted it to be a standalone script instead of a U script, so here it is.

I don't advise "curl-pipe-to-bash" scripts for security purposes, especially those that involve sudo access.
However, if you understand the risks of it, want to just apply this, and be done, you can run this command:
```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Willamin/dark-slack/master/dark-slack | sudo /usr/bin/env ruby
```
