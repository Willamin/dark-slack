# Dark Slack Helper

This is a standalone script that was taken straight from [a script from WA9ACE's U](https://gitlab.com/WA9ACE/U/blob/master/packages/slack.rb).

I just wanted it to be a standalone script instead of a U script, so here it is.

I don't advise "curl-pipe-to-bash" scripts for security purposes, but if you understand the risks of it, want to just apply this, and be done, you can run this command:
```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Willamin/dark-slack/master/dark-slack | /bin/bash
```
